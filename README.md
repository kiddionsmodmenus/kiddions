## How to Install Kiddions Mod Menu

Installing the Kiddions Mod Menu is straightforward, especially on PC. Follow these steps for a smooth setup:

1. **Download the Latest Version**: Head to the official GitHub repository and grab the ZIP file. Extract it to a dedicated folder on your desktop. 📥

2. **Prepare GTA 5**: Ensure your game is updated to the latest version via Rockstar Launcher. Close any antivirus temporarily to avoid false positives.
